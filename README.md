# A Bioconductor workflow for processing and analysing isobaric tagging proteomics data

### Abstract

This manuscript describes a detailed R/Bioconductor workflow for the
analysis and interpretation of isobaric tagging (iTRAQ/TMT) mass
spectrometry-based quantitative proteomics. We start by demonstrating
a detailed analysis of a TMT 10-plex raw file, walking users through
the quantification and identification of the data to produce an
annotated quantitation result object, and how this is then scaled up
to analyse more complex experiments composed of multiple
acquisitions. We then continue and describe how to perform a
statistical analysis of shotgun proteomics data, a spatial proteomics
data analysis, and a thermal proteomics profiling analysis using
dedicated R/Bioconductor infrastructure.
